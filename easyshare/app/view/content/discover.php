<h1>Discover Easyshare</h1>

<div id="discoverpage">
<p>Easyshare facilitates self-managed, fractional ownership of individual assets. This type of shared ownership is nothing new.  It is widely used in small private aircraft, powerboats and yachts.  They are largely owned this way because, for most, the costs of enjoying these pleasures are prohibitively high and they are hardly ever utilized fully with just one owner.  When the costs are shared you will be amazed at what you can achieve.  If there is something you want but can’t quite justify or if you already own something you can’t quite maintain, Easyshare is the financial solution for you. </p>
