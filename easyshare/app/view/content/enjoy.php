<h1>Enjoy Easyshare</h1>

<div id="discoverpage">
<p>Once you have joined or set up a group, you are ready to start enjoying your asset.  Easyshare has specially designed, online software to divide use of the asset between members allowing fair and easy access.  It consists of an online calendar, unique to your asset, and is accessible to all members 24 hours a day.   We support all the popular, known systems of allocation as well as our own intelligent system, which allows each member to book and use the asset as if they owned it entirely.  You just choose the one that suits you and your group’s requirements.  In addition it has a number of other features that are invaluable when running a shared asset. </p>

<p>It is ready for you to use from the moment you place an advert or, if you already run a shared asset, simply register with Easyshare.com and you have access to the online software for your whole group in your “my account” page.  It is the most complete, purpose made system available.</p>
