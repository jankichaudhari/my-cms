<h1>Your Group</h1>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p>The people involved in your group separate this form of ownership from other options such as renting or timeshare.  You are essentially joining or creating a group of people to enjoy your pleasure, a single activity or asset.  It is a personal experience and the creation of a community as those involved in the same hobby or interest usually share much in common.  This encourages respect of the asset and each other.</p>

<p><span style="color:#FFF;">Selection of group members</span></p>

<p>Once the numbers have been set, consider the qualities you are looking for in your group members.  The beauty of this method of ownership is that everyone in the group is an owner and as such has a financial interest.  It is not like renting or timeshare where many unknown people use your asset without having a long-term interest in it.  With Easyshare, only your group members will use the asset and each one has an investment that can be re sold, so everyone has an interest in taking good care of it.</p>

<p>As the initiator of the group, the asset can be further safeguarded by selecting a “good bunch of people”.  It protects your asset but also a pleasant, well-run group makes the shares more saleable now and in the future.  Remember, you are selecting people who are going to become trusted owners with whom you will have many dealings in the future.  Keep this in mind when making contact and selecting potential co-owners.</p>

<p>Consider the make up of your group.  Having some members’ with personal circumstances or jobs that drive a preference for using the asset during the week balanced against others who mostly desire use during the weekend is excellent.  You could also think about the preferred age or experience of members. </p>
