<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc1">
New members must be aged between __ and __ years of age.

<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="c2">Group Entry and Exit</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc2">
Members should base the sale of their share on a market valuation of the asset.  The member may sell for less than the market value but that will be at their own expense.  A member may advertise their share in the asset though any methods provided it does not bring the group into disrepute or lower the overall value of the asset.
<br/><br/>
The seller of the share should ensure the new buyer meets all the criteria listed above under &ldquo;new members&rdquo;.  The seller may show the asset to the new buyer and offer supervised access or use for familiarization and exposure purposes.  The buyer may not use the asset alone.  At all times the insurance criteria for the asset must be maintained.  
<br/><br/>
Once the buyer has expressed an interest in completing the sale, the seller should arrange a meeting with another group member and a &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; arranged.  The purpose of this is for familiarization of group&lsquo;s etiquette and procedures as well as helpful advice for the new member.  The new member should also be deemed to be appropriate and suitable for the group&lsquo;s requirements.  Any member of the group may be tasked with this / the group administrator must be tasked with this / both the administrator and a group member must be tasked with this.  If concern is expressed about the new member, an alternative member may be asked to complete a &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; and state their judgment.  If both are unhappy, the sale may not be processed.
<br/><br/>
Once complete, the details of the buyer shall be passed on to the administrator of the group to complete all the financial and identity details (covered in ID Requirements below).  All company documents will be amended to include the new member.
<br/><br/>
The seller is fully responsible for the asset until the completion of the sale and acceptance of the new member by the group.  The financial transaction should be completed privately and independently.
<br/><br/>
These conditions are set to protect the asset and ensure the group as a whole are pleased with any new member that wants to enter the group.  Shared ownership relies on mutual respect, a good friendly atmosphere and financial security.  New members should be vetted and fit your groups specifications.  Change the wording if required to suit your requirements and the asset.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="c3">ID Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc3">
Each member must provide to the administrator a copy of their passport, relevant license, a bank statement with home address and a credit check from Experian.co.uk.  The credit check must have been completed within the last year.  If the credit check shows a poor reading, the member will be declined / the member may be further investigated and voted on.  All original documents must be viewed with receipt of the photocopies.  All the members&lsquo; copied documents will be kept in a safe place and will not be used for any purpose other than that related to the running of the group.
<br/><br/>
The group administrator will provide the same documents to another member of the group. And show new members should they wish to see them.  
<br/><br/>
If the group is formed of people who have only met in relation to the asset, it is wise to ensure you have verified all their identity details.  The varying values and types of asset to which this contract can be applied, will mean some parts of the above are more relevant than others.  The Experian credit check is free at the moment and may be worth considering as it gives an indication of how credit worthy a member is.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="c6">How the Asset is to be Used</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc6">
Each member will have their own key / use a communal key stored in _________.  The asset will not be used outside the booking times as registered on the online calendar.  If the user is unable (for any reason) to return the vehicle within the booked time and it is going to infringe another members booking, the affected member should be notified as soon as practicable.  Every effort should be made to operate within the booked times.
<br/><br/>
Each member must operate the asset within the requirements of the asset&lsquo;s insurance.  Any person not covered by the insurance / who is not a member may not drive / pilot the asset.
<br/><br/>
Before each use, the member should<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Ensure the asset is free from damage<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Clean<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;etc<br/>
<br/><br/>

After each use the asset should be returned in the following condition:<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Full of fuel / empty of fuel<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Clean, (explain here exactly the standard of cleaning required e.g. external, internal, empty the fridge, hovered etc).<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Parked in the specified position<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Free of damage<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;etc.<br/>
<br/><br/>

Try to be as specific as possible in this section and ensure that each aspect is covered in detail so as to remove any ambiguity and clarify the expectation of each member.  As every asset will be different, stored and accessed in different ways and has differing requirements, it is very hard to complete this section for you.  Give it some consideration.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="c7">Asset Maintenance</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc7">
The asset&lsquo;s requirement for maintenance will take precedence over any bookings in the booking sheet.  Planned maintenance will be added (by the appropriate member) to the booking sheets as far in advance as is practical to minimize the effect on member bookings.  Every effort will be made to ensure that planned maintenance is carried out when the demand for the asset is at it&lsquo;s lowest (out of season).
<br/><br/>
If a member notices the asset is damaged in any way or requires any maintenance, the administrator must be informed immediately.  The administrator will assess which member is responsible for the damage and contact them accordingly.  If the damage is such that maintenance is required either immediately or in the future, the administrator will contact those whose bookings will be affected due to the maintenance action.
<br/><br/>
The person liable for the damage must take responsibility.  If the damage is considered to be &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo; the group may decide to add it to the next maintenance bill covered by the group as a whole.   If it requires repair and the cost is over ______ pounds, a claim will be made from the insurer and any excess invoiced to the liable member.
<br/><br/>
This is a method of arranging the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance requirements.  Amend it to suit the circumstances of the group.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="c8">The Dynamics of the Group</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescc8">
All members will be invited to attend a social meeting once every __ months.  The purpose is to discuss the finances of the group and any associated issues.  It is also an opportunity to discuss any upgrades required or issues that need attention.  All changes will be decided by vote and a majority will pass the action.
<br/><br/>
If a member has been noticed to be consistently operating outside of the agreement outlined in this document or in a manner that is deemed inappropriate by a majority of the group, the group reserves the right to restrict the member&lsquo;s access to the asset until a meeting with the member and the group has taken place.  The subject will then be discussed and an agreement on how to proceed finalised.  The member will receive a yellow card after such a meeting, which is stored on their profile.  After the member has accumulated __ yellow cards, the group has the option to place the offending members share up for sale.  Once a new member has been recruited and the share sold for a price decided by the group, the costs will be recouped to the group accounts from the sale and the remaining monies paid to the outgoing member.
<br/><br/>
It would be foolish not to consider the possibility of having a member who may be a little troublesome.  The group should always run on mutual respect and the members selected to be cohesive.  This is not always possible however and on occasion action maybe required.  The above is a possible way of moving forward.  Consider your options and adapt it to suit your asset.
