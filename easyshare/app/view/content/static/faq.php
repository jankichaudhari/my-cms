<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f1">Why should I use Easyshare?	</span></p>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f2">Why should I consider this concept of ownership?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf2">It is a cost effective, low maintenance way of owning a high value asset.  If you already own an asset, you can immediately realize at least half of the equity in it, cut your costs by an equal amount while still getting as much use as you desire.  If you are seeking to buy an asset, Easyshare is the most accessible and effective finance package available for the reasons stated above.  You enjoy substantially reduced purchase and running costs.  Unlike renting, you own your asset so when you come to sell, you get your investment back.  Even depreciation costs are shared.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f3">What kinds of assets are suitable for Easyshare?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf3">Any asset can be shared but some are more suitable than others.  Clearly, if you require full time use of it, you will have trouble sharing.  Equally low priced objects make less sense.  Assets that work well are often leisure-based, expensive indulgences or high value specialist industrial equipment.  Examples; aircraft, cars, horses, boats and yachts, jet skies, tractors, debentures, exclusive jewelry, garden equipment, holiday property (sun or ski)&hellip;  The list is quite literally endless! </span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f4">How can use of the asset be split equally between group members?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf4">Easyshare&lsquo;s online asset management software offers the solution.  Each member has individual access to your group&lsquo;s online booking page and the reservations are made within that on an online calendar.  Fairness and availability are maintained by selecting booking rules within which each member must operate.   Easyshare automatically enforces these rules for you.  The rules ensure everyone has fair and equal access to the asset stopping double bookings, preventing anyone from taking advantage and maximizing availability for everyone.  All members can forward plan their bookings but still gain access at the last minute.  It&lsquo;s almost like owning the aircraft alone. See Easyshare Allocation <a href="#">here</a>.</span></p>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f5">What is a good sized group?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf5">The group size should be based on your anticipated use of the asset.  A larger group offers less availability but lowers each individual&lsquo;s cost and vise versa.  Suitable group size is therefore dependant on your circumstances and the type of asset.  As a general rule for a leisure asset, a number between 5 and 10 is a good compromise.</span></p>
 </div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f6">What happens if I want to sell my share?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf6">Simply place a free advert on Easyshare and find a buyer for your share.  You will need the agreement of your fellow owners on the acceptance of the new member.</span></p>
 </div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f7">What if a group member damages the asset?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf7">The asset must be comprehensively insured.  Our sponsored insurance partners have been selected for their reputation and compatibility with Easyshare.  They will ensure the asset is properly insured for multiple users.<a href="#">Insurance</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f8">How is ownership structured?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf8">The most common method is to set up a limited liability partnership (company), allow the company to own the asset and then for everyone to have equal shares in the company.  A contract is then drawn up between group members outlining details and responsibilities. <a href="#">Company formation</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f9">What about depreciation or appreciation?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf9">The asset will depreciate or appreciate as expected but like all the other costs or benefits; it is shared between all members.  You are therefore exposed to a much smaller part of the deprecation but get to enjoy a portion of the appreciation.  </span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f10">What if a group member encounters financial difficulty?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf10">The groups contract will cover this and our sponsored legal advisor will talk through options should you require.  The solution lies in the equity each group member has invested in the asset.  After a contractually stated process of trying to retrieve the owed money from the member, their membership can be revoked and their share re sold on Easyshare.  The money raised from the sale is then used to settle any outstanding payments owed. <a href="#">Contract Formation</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f11">What if a member takes advantage of the groups goodwill?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf11">Engaging with problem members should be covered in the group contract.  This will include subjects such as lateness, cleanliness, etc.  Easyshare&lsquo;s allocation system makes it impossible for a single member to abuse the booking allowances and the administrator can sanction the users online privileges should this be necessary.  Remember, a good group relies on mutual respect so most conflicts within a group will be amicably resolved.  <a href="#">Contract Formation</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f12">What if I don&lsquo;t find enough people to share my asset?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf12">Consider starting the group with fewer members, provided everyone already recruited is in agreement, but continue to search for the extra member(s).  When recruited, reduce further all the group charges to reflect this.  Remember with just one other person involved, all costs are halved.  Not a bad start!</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f13">Will having to share with strangers cause difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf13">You should only share with people you like as you select everyone yourself.  The beauty of this kind of ownership is that everyone is an owner and as such has a financial interest in the asset.  You know everyone and everyone knows you.  It is not like time-share or renting in this respect.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="f14">Where can I store my Asset?</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescf14">Often you can keep your asset exactly where it is now.  If this is not conducive to being accessed by others, you can consider storage solutions.  We have on our site under affilliates, a list of people who will store your asset safely, clean it between uses and ensure that it is ready for the next person.  If your asset requires some sort of stores on board, they will ensure they are maintained.  But it is expensive I hear you say!  This shouldn&lsquo;t concern you as the cost will be split between all members making it affordable and convenient.</span></p>
