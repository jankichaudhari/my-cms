<h1>Creating a New Group</h1>

<div id="newGroup">
Setting up a new group can be completed in a few easy steps.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="n1">1.&nbsp;Select the asset you want.</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescn1">
&nbsp;Go through the usual process of selecting your asset from standard retailers (new or used).  Once you have found what you want, get some high quality images showing off the asset.  It is a good idea, at this stage, to gather as much information as possible on the financial commitments associated with your purchase.
&nbsp;<br/><br/>
&nbsp;The asset is the most important part of the whole process.  Make the most of your resource and encourage people to buy into your asset by ensuring it appeals to most tastes.  Think carefully about including features that are specific to your own preferences.  It is, for example, well known that a house sells better if it is painted in neutral colors as more people feel at home.

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="n2">2.&nbsp;Work out the finances.</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescn2">Controlling the finances of the group is important and should be carefully considered.  It is essential if you want a well-run group.  There are 3 categories to consider when setting up the finances&hellip;
<br/><br/>
<span id="orangeText">1.</span>&nbsp;The purchase costs: All the costs involved with purchasing the asset.<br/>
<span id="orangeText">2.</span>&nbsp;The variable costs: All the costs directly related to the use of the asset.  On a car, servicing at mileage intervals would be a good example.  Every mile traveled incurs a cost.<br/>
<span id="orangeText">3.</span>&nbsp;The fixed costs:  Any cost incurred that is based on a time interval.  The same cost occurs no matter how much or little the asset is used.  Good example would be a yearly tax payment on the car.<br/>
<br/>
Summarise all the costs associated with purchasing, running and owning the asset under the three titles listed above.  Note the cost, the variable it is based on and how often it needs to be done.  Be sure to use a realistic or even take a mildly pessimistic viewpoint.  If a cost is incurred when either a time limit or usage limit is reached (see example below), consider which will be reached first when calculating the likely costs per year.  Take into account that with multiple users, usages will be higher than compared with sole ownership. 
<br/><br/>
Example: A service - &pound;300 (average), based on miles or time, 10000 miles or a year.
<br/><br/>
Enter all the costs you have gathered above into Easyshare&lsquo;s Cost Calculator <a href="#">here</a> and it will calculate a, per member purchase cost, per member monthly charge and per member usage charge.  This is best completed now as these are the prices you must place in your advert. 
</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="n3">3.&nbsp;Place your advert.</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescn3">You are now ready to place the advert.  Just follow the easy steps <a href="#">here</a> and provide as much useful information as possible.  Ensure you have good quality pictures for people to browse allowing them to get a good idea of your asset.  Don&lsquo;t forget to mention that you use Easyshare&lsquo;s allocation software to run your asset.  It is synonymous with a well-run group.  It is in your best interests to increase exposure of your asset by successfully using all resources at your disposal.  Sites like Facebook and Twitter allow you to freely expose your asset to a large community of people.  The best thing with social networks is that most of the people to see your advert will be somehow associated to you already.  You could even advertise on sites like E-Bay or Amazon if you have seller accounts.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="n4">4.&nbsp;Set up Easyshare&lsquo;s online management software.</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescn4">The allocation software we provide has been specially designed for Easyshare and the concept of shared ownership.  It is an invaluable management tool for your asset that is set up and ready to use from the moment you place your advert.  Included are a number of very useful functions which organise who has use of the asset when, remind the group when maintenance is required, arranges the finances and billing for the group and allow all members to stay in touch with one another.  It takes all the headaches out of running your asset successfully.  Learn more about it <a href="#">here</a>.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="n5">5.&nbsp;With members recruited (all or some) purchase and realize your group.</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescn5">Once members have been recruited you need to gather the money and purchase your asset.  Banker&lsquo;s drafts are a secure way of doing this.  Use our simple company set up page <a href="#">here</a> to mutually own the asset and set up a bank account.  Use Easyshare&lsquo;s recommended group contract <a href="#">here</a> and adapt it as necessary for your group&lsquo;s requirements.  Insure your asset for multiple users <a href="#">here</a> and finally invite your members to join your group <a href="#">here</a>.
<br/>
If you haven&lsquo;t yet got your desired number of members but are impatient to start the group, just start.  Even with two people, you have already halved all your costs.  As more members are recruited you can further reduce them.  Persuade your current members and come to an agreement.
