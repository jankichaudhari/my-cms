<h1>Running your Asset</h1>

<div id="runningAsset">

<p>A well run, friendly group is what we are attempting to achieve. This is largely realised by having a good set of people involved but also having the administration side well in hand.  Getting this right from the start makes owning, using and running the asset a pleasure.  Everyone should know where they stand in all situations and everything kept as transparent as possible.  With the help of this guide and Easyshare, this is easily achieved.  Everything in this section should be considered before placing your advert.</p>

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r1">Maintenance</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr1">
When advertising, potential group members will be very interested in the maintenance requirements and its cost, assuming your asset has a requirement for maintenance.  You would be well advised to spend some time researching this and documenting the requirements specific to your asset.  When budgeting, spend a little more on maintenance and don’t necessarily take the cheapest option.  The asset is going to be well utilized so ensuring it is correctly maintained is essential.  Remember the cost will be shared so you can afford a little more.
<br/><br/>
The maintenance has a major impact on the finances of the group so when researching the asset’s requirements, be sure to find out the cost.  It will be useful for the finance section if at this stage you can break down the costs into fixed or variable.
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Fixed costs include maintenance that needs to be carried out on specific set dates irrespective of use.  In the case of a car, a MOT would be a good example.  It is required every year weather or not the car is used in order to keep it roadworthy.
<br/>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Variable costs would be costs directly related to the use of the asset.  Servicing at mileage intervals on a car would be a good example.  Every mile travelled incurs a cost. The cost per mile can then be calculated by taking the average cost of a service and dividing it by the number of miles between each service.
<br/><br/>
The more comprehensive your knowledge of the maintenance and its relative costs, the more successful your groups finances will be.  See <a href="#">here</a> for a handy cost calculator.

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r2">Storage</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr2">
Storage is specific to the asset but has implications on the smooth running of the group.  You may choose to store your asset at your house, depending what it is and how big it is.  This has obvious cost benefits but it may not be the best option.  A group member wants ease of access with minimum disruption to anyone else, a clean asset, kept safely and all for a reasonable cost.  As an example of the options, there are companies that will store cars for you, then deliver it to wherever is required on request.  When the company picks up the car again, they clean it, service it and ensure it is ready for the next outing.  This is the other extreme to storing something at your house and may be over the top and expensive for some but very practical for others.  Be sure to give all the options some thought.  Your goal is to provide the easiest access for all members while still ensuring the asset is safe and well looked after.

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r3">Access</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr3">
Consider how all members will access the asset.  Will a key be kept centrally at a neutral location or will all the owners have a copy of the key?  Can it be accessed without the input of another member so making access easier?  Does the system ensure the safety and tracking of the asset?  See <a href="#">storage</a>.
</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r4">Fuel</span>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr4">
If your asset is a type that requires fuel, the implications are finance and availability.  There are three ways of managing the fuel and its cost.
<br/><br/>
<span id="orangeText">1.</span>	Ensuring the fuel tanks are left full by the previous user and the user picks up the cost incurred immediately.<br/>
<span id="orangeText">2.</span>	Create a fuel account and include the fuel costs into the charges for using the asset.  A receipt based system.<br/>
<br/>
The decision will most likely be based on circumstance or the availability of the type of fuel required.  Choose the option that has the least complications.

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r5">Usage Rules</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr5">
Once a group has been established it is important to ensure that each member has equal access to the asset. You are unlikely to do this successfully with a free-for-all booking system. The two best methods for achieving this are:

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r6">Legal Ownership Structure</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr6">
The best way of structuring ownership of a shared asset is by setting up a company.  The company owns the asset and each member owns equal shares in the company.  This has many benefits.  It means that no one person is required to be the &ldquo;legal owner&rdquo; thus taking sole responsibility of the asset in terms of bills and insurance.  As a company, everyone is an equal shareholder so the business becomes the owner of the asset.  It also allows you to get better insurance rates.  Company insurance is cheaper for multiple users than having private insurance with named users.   
<br/><br/>
Setting up a company is very simple.  You only need to think of the name!  The type of company you are best advised to form is a limited liability partnership (LLP).   We have carefully selected a company that will set this up for you.  They check if the name is available, register it and take care of all the paperwork formalising the agreement between the members for a small fee.  It’s as easy as that.  Simply fill in the form <a href="#">here</a> and you will be e-mailed back with the relevant details.
</span></p>
</div>

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r7">Insurance</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr7">
The asset must be properly insured.  It should offer investment protection for each member should anything unexpected happen.  If the group is set up as we suggest where by the company owns the asset and the group members&rsquo; own shares in the company (see <a href="#">legal ownership structure</a>), you can achieve the most cost competitive insurance premiums for multiple users.  See details in the <a href="#">Link Centre</a> under insurance.

<div class="expBlockBg"><p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="r8">Finance</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescr8">
Controlling the finances of the group is vital.  It is very easy, especially with the help of Easyshare.  Initially it requires some thought and planning but much like the rules of the group, once set up, will run itself.  It is best to cover this before your asset is advertised so prospective owners can enquire and know what to expect.  It would be wise to read the maintenance section above as the subjects are very closely related.
<br/><br/>
There are 3 categories to consider when setting up the finances;
<br/><br/>
<span id="orangeText">1.</span>	The purchase costs: All the costs involved with purchasing the asset.<br/>
<span id="orangeText">2.</span>	The variable costs: All the costs directly related to the use of the asset.  Servicing at mileage intervals on a car would be a good example.  Every mile travelled incurs a cost.<br/>
<span id="orangeText">3.</span>	The fixed costs:  Any cost incurred that is based on a time interval.  The same cost occurs no matter how much or little the asset is used.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, summarise all the costs associated with purchasing, running and owning the asset under the three titles listed above.  Note the cost, the variable it is based on and how often it needs to be done.  To do this, use all sources available to you.  If you are buying a new asset ask the dealer/seller for their advice and/or that of a reputable maintenance specialist.  Be sure to mention Easyshare to everyone with which you have dealings.  We may have arranged some favourable rates.  If you already own the asset, you probably have a very good idea of the requirements.  Some costs have a time based limit and a usage limit depending on which occurs first.  In this situation, assume you will reach the usage limit before the time limit because this is more likely with several owners.
<br/><br/>
Enter all the costs you have gathered above into Easyshare’s Cost Calculator <a href="#">here</a>.  It will calculate a, per member purchase cost, per member monthly charge and per member usage charge.  Job done!  These are the prices you place in your advert and what each group member will pay.  It is usually at this point that you begin to wonder, why would you own an asset of this type any other way!  
<br/><br/>
Do remember, the costs can and will have to be amended from time to time due to fluctuations in prices and, despite excellent planning, unexpected expenses do appear.  It is important to ensure that the group’s bank balance remains healthy and stays in the black.  It is often wise to budget a little more than you think as this gives you the luxury of a buffer for unexpected events.  Any unspent funds can then either be redistributed amongst the group at the end of the year or spent on extra / replacement equipment for the asset if agreed by all members.  Better to have too much than too little.
<br/><br/>
Once the group is up and running, you need to ensure every member is billed appropriately and pays into the company account.  Once again, Easyshare comes to the rescue.  The same costs you have worked out above are entered into the &ldquo;lMy Groups&rdquo; feature when you first set it up and Easyshare does the rest.  Every member, after using the asset, enters their usage and Easyshare will automatically bill members with the appropriate usage charge and monthly charge at the interval of your choice.  It is all easy to track and transparent and most importantly, automatic!
