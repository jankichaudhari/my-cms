<div id="allocation">
Easyshare&lsquo;s online allocation software has been specially designed for Easyshare and the concept of shared ownership.  It is an invaluable management tool for your asset that is set up and ready to use from the moment you place your advert and has a number of very useful functions.  It will organise who has use of the asset when, remind the group when maintenance is required, arranges the finances and billing for the group and allow all members to stay in touch with one another.  It takes all the headaches out of running your asset successfully.  

When first setting up “My Groups” you are taken through a simple introduction and configuration to make it specific to your requirements.  Input the information you have gathered from all the stages above and invite your members.  They can then log on and access the group through their own Easyshare “My Account” page.

Easyshare provides an endless calendar on which people log in and make bookings to use the asset.  The software is pre programmed by you with the rules of the group and prevents anyone making bookings that are outside these specifications.  It ensures booking the asset is fully automated, fair and can be accessed by anyone at any time from anywhere (see usage rules).

The finances of the group are maintained using Easyshare.  Billing is totally automated and the group accounts completely transparent for all members to see.  When the group is first set up on Easyshare, the balance of the group&lsquo;s bank account is entered.  From that point any withdrawals or deposits are itemized and can be viewed by all members.  Whilst this is controlled and monitored by the administrator or the nominated finance controller for the group, the automated billing functions ensure they have very little to do.  Bills are automatically generated and issued to all the members at a predefined time.  When the bill is paid, the system automatically updates the group&lsquo;s bank balance on the system.  Once set up, the finances almost run themselves (see finance).

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="a3">Maintenance</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDesca3">
The maintenance facility is run using the same inputs as the billing system.  All the maintenance requirements of the asset will be based on either time or usage.  Both of these are monitored by Easyshare and provided you have entered the date or usage limit maintenance is required, it will remind you and if it is your preference, prevent any more bookings being made until the relevant maintenance has been carried out.

<p><span class="expBlockTitle" id="a4">Message Centre</span></p>
<p><span class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDesca4">
Once logged on, you are able to send messages to any member of the group or the group as a whole.

This online software allows you to run your group in the most efficient and effective way.  It makes the role of the administrator very simple, but it is your group members that get the most benefit.  They enjoy easy and fair access to the asset and all the groups&lsquo; vital information.  Don&lsquo;t forget to mention on your advert that you use Easyshare to run the asset, as people associate it with a well-run group.  It is completely autonomous, runs 24 hours a day, can be accessed anywhere and is already setup ready for you to use from the moment your group is advertised.  Just try it!
