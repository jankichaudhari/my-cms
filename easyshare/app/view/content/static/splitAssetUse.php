<h1>How to split use of the asset between members</h1>

<div id="splitAssetUse">
<p>Once a shared asset group has been established it is important to ensure that each member has equal access to the asset. You are unlikely to do this successfully with a free-for-all booking system. The two best methods for achieving this are:</p>

<div class="expBlockBg">
    <div class="expBlockTitle" id="s1">1) Run the Group with a rule-based booking system</div>
    <div class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescs1">
   <p> A flexible system allowing group members to book the asset when they want it.  This is achieved by using an endless, future-looking calendar.  Bookings in this calendar are made within the confines of a set of rules to which everyone adheresand are automatically enforced.  They are based upon limiting the number of days on which bookings can be made and the limit is set as the number of bookings each member is allowed in the calendar at any one time. </p>
    
    <p>It is important to understand what is meant by the phrase at “any one time”.  You may make bookings next year or indeed the year after should you desire, but they will use up part of your total allowance, restricting the number of bookings available in the nearer future.  This is what is meant by the phrase “bookings allowed in the calendar at any one time”.  </p>
    
    <p>All the rules are optional and interchangeable but can include the following limitations:</p>
    
    <div class="bookingTypes">
    <p><span style="color:#FFF;">Total Booking Days</span></p>
    <p>Limit the total number of days on which a member is allowed to have bookings.  The limit is set as a total number of “booking days” allowed on the calendar at any one time. </p>
    
    <p><span style="color:#FFF;">Weekend Bookings Days</span></p>
     <p>Saturdays and Sundays are often the most popular days.  To ensure all group members have equal access to the asset at weekends, you can separately limit how many weekend booking days each member is allowed in the calendar at any one time. </p>
    
    <p><span style="color:#FFF;">Holiday Bookings (Extended bookings)</span></p>
    <p> From time to time group members may wish to book the asset for a period longer than one day. To cater for this whilst preventing users repetitively block booking the asset, limit how often each member can make one of these extended bookings. First determine how many consecutive days constitutes a ‘Holiday Booking’ and then limit the number of these that each member is allowed in the calendar at any one time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>To determine the correct member limits, think about the type of asset, the way it will be used (for short periods or long periods) and the number of members within the group. As a guide, for a group of 5 -10 people in joint ownership of a leisure vehicle, a good starting point would be limits of;</p>
    
    <div  class="bookingTypes">
    <p>
        <span>Total Booking Days:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#FFF;">30</span><br/>
        <span>Weekend Booking Days:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#FFF;">2</span><br/>
        <span>Number of days that constitute a Holiday Booking:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#FFF;">4 + </span><br/>
        <span>Holiday Bookings Allowed:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#FFF;">1</span><br/>
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>With the limits set as above, a holiday booking can last no more than 12 days due to the “weekend booking days” restriction.  You can change these limits as your group evolves and you learn its requirements.  </p>
    
    <p>Once an individual reaches their booking limits for any of the categories above (total booking days, weekend booking days or holiday bookings), no more of that type can be made until you either cancel a booking or, as time moves forward, your bookings are used.  This replenishes your booking allowance.  All members are therefore continuously working around each other as allowances permit.  It is a continuous and endless process allowing everyone equal opportunity to use the asset.  </p>
    <br/>
    <p><span style="color:#FFF;">Note</span> - Members won’t use up their full booking allowance at all times.  Life commitments restrict this.  The allowances should be generous enough to enable you to make forward planned bookings but still have days left over to make bookings at short notice.  The more restrictive peak days (i.e. weekend days or lengthy bookings) require a little more planning and consideration which allows everyone a chance to get the days they want fitting an individual’s lifestyle, closely replicating whole ownership.</p>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<div class="expBlockTitle" id="s2">2) Run the Group with an Allocation Rota.</div>
<div class="expBlockDesc" id="expBlockDescs2">
<p> An allocation rota will allocate the asset to group members on a rotational basis. The duration of each rotation is optional and will vary with the type of asset and the group size. With group sizes of between two and ten members a weekly rotation works well. For example a group consisting of four members on a seven-day allocation rota will work like this:</p>
<br/>
<p>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 1</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member A</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 2</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member B</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 3</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member C</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 4</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member D</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 5</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member A</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 6</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member B</span><br/>
<span style="color:#FFF;">Week 7</span>&nbsp;– the asset is allocated to<span style="color:#FFF;">&nbsp;Member C</span><br/>
</p>
<br/>
<p>And so on…..</p>

<p>As a member of a group run in this manner, you will have access to the asset every four weeks for a period of 7 days.</p>
<br/>
<p><span style="color:#FFF;">Summary</span></p>

<p>The Allocation Rota system is very simple but quite restrictive and inflexible potentially reducing the utilization of the asset.  It does not allow for last minute changes or last minute access if available.  For some assets however it may be the most suitable system. </p>

<p>Conversely, the Rule based system offers ultimate flexibility.  Our feedback clearly champions it as the preferred system for most asset types.  It allows you to forward plan your bookings, fitting around your life and commitments but you can still get access at late notice on a whim, closely replicating whole ownership. </p>

<p>Easyshare’s online allocation software supports the Rule Based and the Allocated Rota Systems.  It is displayed as an endless online calendar accessed by any member using their individual Easyshare account.  The administrator presets all the rule limits discussed above to complement the group’s dynamics (they can be changed at any time). You may leave some of the rules inactive as appropriate allowing creativity, personalizing them for your specific needs.  Easyshare then enforces your rules, preventing bookings being made outside a user’s allowance keeping the assets use fair and orderly.  It becomes the secretary for the group, preventing double bookings and any confusion, requires no monitoring and works twenty-four hours a day.  A fantastic tool making the whole process effortless.</p>
