<h1>Cost Calculator</h1>

<div class="expBlockBg">
<p>This facility allows you to enter all your costs associated with your asset.  It calculates the purchase, monthly and per use charges each member will have to pay.  Enter the figures but remember to ensure all the fixed and variable costs are based on the same variable.  For example, cars costs are all based on miles or kilometers.  If the cost is based on mileage (or equivalent usage variable) OR a time interval, it is best to use the usage variable.  With multiple users you are much more likely to reach this limit first.</p>

<p>The figures shown are an example.  Simply delete and update as appropriate to calculate the purchase, monthly and per use costs for members.  Use these figures in your advert and, when required, in Easyshareâ€™s online allocation software.</p>
